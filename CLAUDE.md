- **Theming**: Comprehensive light/dark mode support with ReRoom brand colors
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with theme-aware components
- **Path Aliases**: Use `@/components/ui`, `@/theme/*`, `@/hooks/*` imports
- **Theme Provider**: All screens wrapped with ThemeProvider for consistent styling
- **Color System**: Primary (#0066FF), Secondary, Accent colors with semantic variants
- **Theme Files**: `@/theme/colors.ts`, `@/theme/globals.ts`, `@/theme/theme-provider.tsx`

### Recent Debug & Fixes (August 2025)
- **âœ… SAM2 Mask Visualization System**: Completely resolved mask display issues using canvas-based pixel processing
  - Fixed CORS errors by implementing proxy routing (`/api/masks/...` â†’ `ovalay-recruitment-production.up.railway.app`)
  - Replaced failing CSS mask approach with canvas 2D pixel manipulation for reliable rendering
  - Implemented green/blue color coding (active/inactive objects) with transparent backgrounds
  - Achieved perfect SAM2 segmentation overlay visualization in production review dashboard
- **YOLO Object Detection**: Resolved missing ultralytics dependency â†’ restored object identification capability
- **Database Schema**: Fixed mask_url/mask_r2_key mismatch â†’ preserved mask URLs for frontend while maintaining R2 storage
- **CORS Issues**: Implemented custom static file serving with proper headers for mask image access
- **API Connectivity**: Resolved frontend-backend communication failures â†’ added error handling and timeout management
- **JSX Syntax Errors**: Fixed multiple component export and structure issues in review dashboard
- **Taxonomy Enhancement**: Expanded from 10 to 28 categories with 200+ furniture items for comprehensive object detection
- **Railway URL Alignment**: Synchronized frontend and backend to use correct production endpoints

### Key Development Notes
- Always use pnpm, not npm or yarn (pnpm@9.12.0 required)
- Mobile app uses Expo managed workflow with BNA UI components
- Backend has unified cloud service (v2.0.0) on Railway with legacy microservices
- AI service requires significant memory (8GB+ Docker allocation)
- Pre-commit hooks automatically format and lint code
- Use `pnpm run clean` to reset node_modules if needed
- BNA UI components should be used instead of raw React Native components for consistency
- Mobile app structure: Expo Router with file-based routing in `src/app/`
- Current screens: index (home), camera, gallery, makeover with planned (tabs) navigation
- Architecture is transitioning from microservices to hybrid cloud + legacy approach
- **SAM2 Mask System**: Masks generated via neural segmentation, served via Railway static endpoint, rendered using canvas-based pixel processing with transparent overlays for perfect visualization
- **Frontend Visualization**: Canvas 2D API processes mask pixels to show green (active) and blue (inactive) object boundaries over room images
- **CORS Resolution**: Proxy configuration routes `/api/masks/...` requests through local dev server to bypass cross-origin restrictions
- **Error Handling**: API calls include retry logic and graceful degradation for improved reliability
