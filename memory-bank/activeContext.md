## Technical Decisions Made

### ✅ Established Patterns
1. **Environment Management**
   - Use .env file for all configuration
   - Docker Compose for local infrastructure
   - Service-based architecture with health checks

2. **Mobile Development**
   - Expo Router for navigation (not React Navigation)
   - TypeScript strict mode for type safety
   - Simplified app.json without complex plugins initially

3. **Infrastructure**
   - All databases containerized for consistency
   - MinIO instead of AWS S3 for local development
   - Qdrant ready for future AI vector operations

### 🎯 Current Decisions Needed
1. **AI Integration Approach:** Direct API calls vs SDK wrapper for SAM2 endpoints
2. **Results Display:** Real-time streaming vs batch processing for UI updates
3. **Data Persistence:** Local caching strategy for AI processing results
4. **User Experience:** Progressive disclosure of advanced AI features vs full display

## Challenges Solved

### 🚨 Major Issues Resolved
1. **ESLint Peer Dependencies**
   - Problem: Version 9 incompatible with TypeScript plugins
   - Solution: Downgraded to ESLint 8.56.0 for compatibility

2. **Docker Connectivity**
   - Problem: Network issues preventing image pulls
   - Solution: Docker Desktop restart + v2 syntax

3. **Empty App Configuration**
   - Problem: app.json was completely empty causing Expo failure
   - Solution: Created proper Expo configuration with essential settings

4. **Missing Assets**
   - Problem: Expo looking for non-existent image files
   - Solution: Created placeholder assets and simplified configuration

### 🛠 Technical Fixes Applied
- Docker Compose version attribute removed (obsolete in v2)
- Environment variables properly configured for all services
- Service health checks implemented for reliability
- Simplified Expo plugins to essential only

## Performance & Monitoring

### 📊 Current System Performance
