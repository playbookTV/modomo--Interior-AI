```

## Immediate Next Steps (Next 7 Days)

### 🎯 Priority 1: Camera Integration
**Goal:** Enable photo capture with quality guidance
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install and configure react-native-vision-camera
- [ ] Add camera permissions to app.json
- [ ] Create camera screen with UI controls
- [ ] Implement photo capture with quality checks
- [ ] Add photo preview and retake functionality

### 🎯 Priority 2: Photo Management
**Goal:** Local photo handling and optimization
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install react-native-image-resizer
- [ ] Implement photo compression and optimization
- [ ] Create local storage for captured photos
- [ ] Add metadata extraction (dimensions, orientation)
- [ ] Implement photo gallery/history view

### 🎯 Priority 3: Backend Foundation
**Goal:** Basic API structure for photo upload
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create authentication service skeleton
- [ ] Implement photo upload endpoint
- [ ] Connect to MinIO S3 storage
- [ ] Add basic error handling and logging
- [ ] Create health check endpoints

## Technical Decisions Made

### ✅ Established Patterns
1. **Environment Management**
   - Use .env file for all configuration
   - Docker Compose for local infrastructure
   - Service-based architecture with health checks

2. **Mobile Development**
   - Expo Router for navigation (not React Navigation)
   - TypeScript strict mode for type safety
   - Simplified app.json without complex plugins initially

3. **Infrastructure**
   - All databases containerized for consistency
   - MinIO instead of AWS S3 for local development
   - Qdrant ready for future AI vector operations

### 🎯 Upcoming Decisions Needed
1. **Camera Library:** react-native-vision-camera vs expo-camera
2. **Photo Storage:** Local MMKV vs AsyncStorage for metadata
3. **Backend Framework:** Express.js vs Fastify for APIs
4. **Database Schema:** Design for users, photos, processing jobs

### 🔧 Key Configuration Files
- **/.env** - Complete environment variables for all services
- **/docker-compose.yml** - Database and storage services
- **/mobile/app.json** - Expo configuration (simplified for stability)
- **/package.json** - Workspace configuration with pnpm

## Challenges Solved

### 🚨 Major Issues Resolved
1. **ESLint Peer Dependencies**
   - Problem: Version 9 incompatible with TypeScript plugins
   - Solution: Downgraded to ESLint 8.56.0 for compatibility

2. **Docker Connectivity**
   - Problem: Network issues preventing image pulls
   - Solution: Docker Desktop restart + v2 syntax

3. **Empty App Configuration**
   - Problem: app.json was completely empty causing Expo failure
   - Solution: Created proper Expo configuration with essential settings

4. **Missing Assets**
   - Problem: Expo looking for non-existent image files
   - Solution: Created placeholder assets and simplified configuration

### 🛠 Technical Fixes Applied
- Docker Compose version attribute removed (obsolete in v2)
- Environment variables properly configured for all services
- Service health checks implemented for reliability
- Simplified Expo plugins to essential only

## Performance & Monitoring

### 📊 Current System Performance
- **Container Startup:** ~10 seconds for all services
- **Mobile Build:** TypeScript compilation successful
- **Hot Reloading:** Functional for immediate development feedback
- **Service Health:** All green, no errors in logs

### 🔍 Monitoring Setup
- Docker container health checks active
- Expo development server with live reload
- Service logs accessible via `pnpm run docker:logs`
- QR code regeneration for mobile testing

## Knowledge Gained

### 💡 Key Learnings
1. **Expo Configuration:** Simple is better for initial development
2. **Docker Networking:** Health checks prevent downstream issues
3. **Environment Variables:** Centralized .env prevents configuration drift
4. **Dependency Management:** Version alignment critical for monorepos

### 🔄 Improved Processes
- Start with minimal configuration, add complexity gradually
- Use health checks to verify service readiness before proceeding
- Document all configuration decisions in memory bank
- Maintain clear separation between infrastructure and application code

## Next Session Planning

### 🎯 Immediate Goals
1. **Camera Integration** - Get photo capture working end-to-end
2. **Photo Upload** - Basic backend endpoint receiving images
3. **Storage Testing** - Verify MinIO integration working
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful failures and user feedback

### 📋 Success Criteria
- User can open camera, take photo, see preview
- Photo gets stored locally with proper optimization
- Backend receives photo upload successfully
- Clear development path to AI processing established

### ⚠️ Risk Areas to Watch
- Camera permissions and iOS/Android differences
- Photo size/performance on mobile devices
- Backend service creation complexity
- Integration between mobile and backend services

## Team Context

### 👨‍💻 Current Development Mode
- **Solo Development:** Efficient progress with clear documentation
- **Documentation-First:** Memory bank keeping context across sessions
- **Iterative Approach:** Foundation → Core → Advanced features
- **Quality Focus:** Proper setup prevents future technical debt

### 🎯 Development Philosophy
- Complete foundation before building features
- Document all decisions and patterns
- Solve blockers immediately rather than work around
- Maintain production-ready patterns from day one
