Here’s everything I see, grouped so you can action it fast:

Critical bugs / breakages
	•	Duplicate route definition: @app.get("/jobs/{job_id}/status") is declared twice with different logic (one “friendly fallback”, one hard‑fails w/ 503). The later one wins; behavior is inconsistent and confusing.
	•	Global scope bug for color_extractor: startup()’s global line omits color_extractor. Assigning it inside startup() can shadow the module‑level instance → endpoints may see None.
	•	Null‑guard missing: /colors/extract calls color_extractor.extract_colors(...) without checking if color_extractor is None.
	•	Redis bytes vs str:
	•	/jobs/errors/recent reads hgetall and accesses .get("status") etc. on bytes keys/values → always None.
	•	/jobs/active checks .get("status") on Redis hash before decoding → also wrong.
	•	Undefined functions referenced:
	•	run_full_scraping_pipeline (used in /scrape/scenes) not defined in this file.
	•	run_dataset_import_pipeline (used in /import/huggingface-dataset) not defined here.
	•	classify_image_type (used in /classify/test and reclassification job) not defined here.
	•	Health/security of admin endpoints:
	•	/admin/test-supabase performs insert/delete with no auth guard.
	•	/admin/init-database requires db_pool (but you set db_pool = None in Full‑AI mode) → always 503; dead endpoint.

Logic & consistency issues
	•	Model‑policy contradiction: Top section states “NO MORE FALLBACKS - REAL MODELS ONLY!”, yet startup() still tries “fallback AI implementations” on failure. Mixed signals and divergent behavior.
	•	Detector status mismatch: /debug/detector-status says “Multi-model (YOLO + DETR)” while your detector is GroundingDINO. YOLO presence is optional but currently reported as if required.
	•	Double import / dead guard: torch is imported at module top (hard requirement). Later you “check” AI dependencies with a try/except import of torch again—this guard is moot because the module would already have failed if torch were missing.
	•	Two initializations for ColorExtractor: Force‑initialized at module level and reconstructed in startup() (and again in jobs). Without global, these can diverge.
	•	Job status fallbacks disagree: The earlier status route returns "completed" with 100% when Redis is missing; the later route 503s. Frontend will see contradictory states depending on which handler is active.
	•	Type coercion gaps: The later /jobs/{id}/status decodes bytes but doesn’t coerce numeric fields (progress/total/processed) to int → strings leak to clients.
	•	Hardcoded masks path: Uses /tmp/masks. Fine for a single instance, but in containerized multi‑instance setups you may want a persistent volume or per‑job dir.

Performance & scalability
	•	Redis KEYS usage: /jobs/errors/recent and /jobs/active use keys("job:*") which is O(N) and blocks Redis. Should use SCAN.
	•	N+1 queries:
	•	/scenes loops scenes and queries object counts per scene.
	•	/objects loops objects and queries scene info per object.
	•	Linear search on results: In /search/color, enrichment does object_ids.index(match["object_id"]) for each match (O(n²) worst‑case). Use a dict map for O(1).

API design / DX
	•	Datetime in health: timestamp returns a datetime object—FastAPI will serialize it, but if you proxy this elsewhere, be explicit (.isoformat()).
	•	Color palette assumptions: /colors/palette assumes color_extractor.color_mappings exists; guarded but make sure the extractor always exposes this attribute.
	•	Clip embedding shape trust: /search/color assumes clip_embedding_json is a list of floats; no validation. A malformed row will break similarity calc.
	•	Progress reporting inconsistent: Some background jobs (e.g., dataset import vs color processing vs scraping) appear to report to Redis differently or not at all → status UI inconsistency.

Security / ops posture
	•	CORS is too open: allow_origins=["*"] with allow_credentials=True is problematic (specifically disallowed by browsers). Tighten origins.
	•	Server‑side Supabase key: Using SUPABASE_ANON_KEY for server writes; safer pattern is the service role key with RLS policies.
	•	Unauthenticated admin & job endpoints: No auth/rate limiting on /admin/*, job starters, etc. Risky if exposed.
	•	Verbose env diagnostics: Extensive logs are great, but ensure no secrets ever leak in prod logs.

Data correctness / schema
	•	Local Postgres vs Supabase schema drift: init_database creates objects table; the app elsewhere uses Supabase detected_objects. Intentional or not, naming/schema diverge.
	•	JSON path filter: In run_color_processing_job, the Supabase filter .is_("metadata->colors", "null") depends on PostgREST semantics; verify it matches your actual schema/types (JSON vs JSONB, null vs absent).

Minor nits
	•	Return messages leak internal decisions: e.g., /jobs/{id}/status fallback claims "completed" when tracking is unavailable—misleading; should be "unknown".
	•	Static files under /masks: Serving temp files directly is fine in dev; confirm you’re not exposing sensitive intermediates.
	•	Mixed logging styles: print() for color extractor init alongside structlog—unify for consistency.
