**"Snap. Style. Save."**  
*The AI-powered interior design app that finds the best prices for your perfect room*

### The Opportunity
The Â£280 billion global home furnishing market suffers from massive price inefficiency - **consumers overpay by an average of 40%** because they can't easily compare identical or similar items across retailers. **86% of people check multiple sites before buying furniture**, spending 47 hours researching, yet still end up paying more than necessary because they lack the tools to find the best deals for cohesive looks.

- **ðŸŽ¨ Style:** AI generates professional makeovers in 12+ design aesthetics  
- **ðŸ’° Save:** Instantly find the best prices across 15+ retailers for every suggested item

**The Magic:** Our AI doesn't just show you beautiful rooms - it finds the exact products at the lowest prices, often saving users Â£200-800 per room compared to shopping individually.

Our proprietary AI pipeline combines advanced computer vision (SAM2, Depth-Anything-V2) with custom-trained style transfer models and intelligent product matching to deliver photorealistic room transformations that users trust enough to purchase from.
