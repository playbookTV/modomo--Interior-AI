Got you. If the goal is better identification + clean cutouts, switch from “detector-only” thinking (YOLO/DETR) to a 3‑stage pipeline:
	1.	Find it (robust boxes)
	2.	Trace it (high‑quality instance masks)
	3.	Polish it (alpha matting for crisp edges)

Below is a battle‑tested setup that plays nicely with Hugging Face datasets and your Python stack.

⸻

1) Detection (boxes you can trust)

Best balance (speed + accuracy):
	•	RT‑DETR (or YOLOv8/10) for closed‑vocab classes you care about. Train on your HF mix with your taxonomy.
	•	Open‑vocab “safety net” for long‑tail: GroundingDINO or OWL‑ViT to propose boxes from text prompts (e.g., “sectional sofa”, “pendant light”). Use this when your closed‑vocab misses.

Recipe:
	•	Run RT‑DETR (primary).
	•	Run open‑vocab detector on the same image; soft‑NMS + IoU‑aware fusion to merge boxes (keep novel classes).
	•	Keep top‑k per class by score + size heuristics.

⸻

2) Segmentation (masks that hug edges)

Detectors don’t give you great masks. You want instance segmentation with strong boundaries:
	•	Best plug‑and‑play: SAM 2 (Segment Anything 2). Prompt with the box → get a good instance mask, very resilient to clutter/occlusion.
	•	Sharpening option: HQ‑SAM (high‑quality variant) to improve fine edges (lamp stands, chair legs).
	•	Alternative end‑to‑end: Mask2Former (panoptic/instance) fine‑tuned on interiors/furniture if you want a single model (slower to train, but great masks).

Recipe:
	•	For each box → run SAM2 to get the mask.
	•	If the object is thin/filigree (chairs, lamps), pass the mask through HQ‑SAM or a boundary refinement step (PointRend‑style refinement or simple contour snapping with edge maps).

⸻

3) Clipping (production‑quality cutouts)

Even great masks leave halos. Use alpha matting with a trimap:
	•	Generate trimap from your mask:
	•	Foreground = erode(mask, r)
	•	Background = erode(~mask, r)
	•	Unknown = the band between (dilate–erode)
	•	Run a lightweight matting model on the image + trimap:
	•	Solid choices: FBA Matting, MODNet, or BackgroundMattingV2.
	•	Output RGBA with clean hairline edges and no halo.

Python sketch (trimap + matting):

import cv2, numpy as np

def make_trimap(mask, k=7):
    fg = cv2.erode(mask, np.ones((k,k), np.uint8))
    bg = cv2.erode(1-mask, np.ones((k,k), np.uint8))
    trimap = np.full_like(mask, 128, dtype=np.uint8)
    trimap[fg==1] = 255
    trimap[bg==1] = 0
    return trimap  # 0=bg, 128=unknown, 255=fg

# Then feed (image, trimap) to your matting model to get alpha,
# compose RGBA cutout = concat(image, alpha)


⸻

Identification (matching object → product identity)

You’ll get better matches if you embed the masked crop (background removed):
	•	Embeddings:
	•	Use CLIP (ViT‑L/14 or better) or SigLIP.
	•	Compute vector for the alpha‑composited object (not the raw crop).
	•	Catalog side:
	•	For each catalog image (HF dataset or your own), compute the same embedding.
	•	Store in Postgres + pgvector.
	•	Search & re‑rank:
	•	Cosine similarity top‑N → re‑rank with simple cues: aspect ratio, dominant color, material keywords (from captions or tags).
	•	Optional: BLIP‑2 or CLIP‑Interrogator to generate a text description of the object and match against product titles for a hybrid score.

Tip: Train a tiny category‑specific re‑ranker (e.g., gradient boosted trees) on features like [cosine, color ΔE, IoU of silhouette, area ratio] using your reviewed pairs. It bumps precision a lot with minimal work.

⸻

Concrete pipeline (what to actually run)
	1.	Detection (primary): RT‑DETR (your taxonomy).
	2.	Detection (open‑vocab assist): GroundingDINO with prompts for long‑tail classes.
	3.	Box fusion: Soft‑NMS, drop tiny/noisy boxes.
	4.	Masking: SAM2(box → mask); optional HQ‑SAM refine for thin objects.
	5.	Matting: Trimap → FBA/ MODNet → RGBA cutout.
	6.	Embedding: CLIP(SigLIP) on the RGBA foreground (white/neutral bg).
	7.	Match: pgvector ANN search → re‑rank → candidate list.
	8.	(Optional) Human‑in‑loop: Quick approve/adjust.

⸻

When to fine‑tune vs. stay zero‑/few‑shot
	•	Fine‑tune detector (RT‑DETR/YOLO) on HF subsets + your review set when mAP on your niche classes < 0.6.
	•	Keep SAM2 zero‑shot — it generalizes extremely well; you rarely need to train it.
	•	Consider Mask2Former fine‑tune only if you want a single‑model segmentation (no SAM), and you have lots of good masks.

⸻

Datasets on Hugging Face worth pulling (for interiors/furniture)
	•	ADE20K / SceneParse150 (room stuff + furniture classes)
	•	Open Images (subset with furniture categories)
	•	Hypersim / Structured3D (synthetic but great for room objects)
	•	COCO (baseline classes: chair, couch, potted plant, tv, bed, dining table, etc.)

Mix them, then curate a mini‑val set from your target aesthetic (Houzz‑style) to measure real performance.

⸻

Metrics to track (so you know it’s better)
	•	Detection: mAP@0.5:0.95 (per class).
	•	Segmentation: Mask AP + Boundary F1 (BFScore) — boundary F1 tells you if edges are crisp.
	•	Matting: SAD / MSE on a tiny hand‑labeled set; or proxy with trimap band IoU.
	•	Matching: top‑1 / top‑5 recall against your catalog.

⸻

Quick configs that work well
	•	RT‑DETR: large backbone, 3–5 epochs warmup, EMA on, mosaic off for interiors, img size 1024, strong color jitter (indoor lighting).
	•	SAM2: use box prompt; set stability score high; min region area to suppress specks.
	•	Matting: unknown band ~8–16px; downsample to 1024 on matting then upsample alpha (speed/quality sweet spot).
	•	CLIP: ViT‑L/14@336px; normalize with whitening (fit on catalog embeddings) before ANN.
